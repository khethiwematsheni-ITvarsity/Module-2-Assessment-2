            <b>Synopsis:</b>The Templeton brothers, Tim and his boss baby little bro, Ted, have become adults and drifted away from each other. Tim is now a married, stay-at-home dad. 
            Ted is a hedge fund CEO. But, a new boss baby with a cutting-edge approach and a can-do attitude is about to bring them together again … and inspire a new family business. 
            Tim and his wife, Carol, the breadwinner of the family, live in the suburbs with their super-smart 7-year-old daughter, Tabitha, and adorable new infant, Tina. Tabitha, 
            whoʼs at the top her class at the prestigious Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood, idolises her Uncle Ted and wants to become like him, but Tim, still in touch with his overactive youthful imagination, 
            worries that sheʼs working too hard and is missing out on a normal childhood.
             When baby Tina reveals that sheʼs—ta-da!—a top secret agent for BabyCorp on a mission to uncover the dark secrets behind Tabithaʼs school and its mysterious founder, Dr. Edwin Armstrong, it will reunite the Templeton brothers in unexpected ways, 
             lead them to re-evaluate the meaning of family and discover what truly matters.</p>
